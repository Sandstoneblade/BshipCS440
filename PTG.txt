Playing this game
Our game runs along this model:
Traditional ship distrubtion (5)
Destroyers are size 2
Cruisers are size 3

Attacking: just select a tile.
If your opponent's ship has been hit, the game will ask a historical question.  
You, as the player, must answer correctly for the hit to count.

Should you successfully hit a ship, you will have another another turn.
The game ends when no ships remain on one side.
