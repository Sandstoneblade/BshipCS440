Variations
As battleship is a game that has been around for years, there are many variations of the game.  
Below is a list of a few of the variations.

1 shot per ship:
Each player, rather than having one attack per round, instead has one attack per each ship that is afloat.

Movement (many variations):
Each player, on their turn and after (rule varies) number of turns prior to their last movement, 
may move their ship(s) forward or backward a number of spaces. 
 Movement may be restricted if a ship is damaged.
Turning: Ships may be turned as a movement.

Submarine rules:
Variations in the rules apply for submarines.  Some rulesets restrict a submarine's vulnerabilities 
with respect to being hit.  This is generally only applied to the 1 shot per ship ruleset.

Ship naming:
Each ship class might be named a different catagory of vessel.  
Frigates may replace the submarine, for example.

Battle re-creation:
Rather than five ships per player, a battle can be modeled from historical data, 
with each player representing a side, and each side given a number of ships to represent numbers disparity.

More ships:
Rather than just five ships, with four ship sizes, more can be used 
(a length 6 ship, for example, with each side having 10 ships)
A typical variation is to have the following number of ships and sizes:
1 size 5
1 size 4
1 size 3
2 size 2
2 size 1 (this is typically referred to as 'submarine')

Grid size change:
Rather than a 10x10 grid, the grid may be larger or smaller.

Ship announcement:
Players may, or may not, announce which type of ship (ex: battleship, destroyer) has been struck.

Successful attacks:
Should a player successfully hit a ship, they may have another attack or several attacks.  
Many variations exist.
